Two years after the release of the box office hit movie Barbie, information about the impact and importance of the toy Barbie in the expression of Women’s rights is still not common knowledge. All the focus on the commercialization of merch on the theme pink, Barbie herself, or the famous “I am Kenough” merch has given another image to the brand Mattel. The new image is close to the old ideas of Ruth Handler, creator of Mattle and Barbie but is still different in many forms. 

  
  

### 1. Barbie changed the world of girls

______________________________________________________________________________

  

Barbie, as introduced at the beginning of the movie, changed the world of dolls for girls. As much as this toy is criticized for many aspects, it is important to encounter the changes it has brought to the world of girls. Barbie herself is not directly linked to Women’s rights, but the doll has raised the possibility of feminist ideas of a working world with women in the picture. The creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler,  introduced the world of Barbie through her vision of a new feminine feature toy of the same name as her daughter, Barbara. This doll was made of the dimension of a thin woman and is supposed to represent an adult woman.  Before Barbies, girls played with baby dolls and only had the option of being a mother. Barbies brought to the world of girls the possibility to play with an adult doll with a career. The possible jobs were not housewives or mothers, it was an actual job. It has brought a similar advance to the world of girls, as toy soldiers brought to boys years before. 

  

### 2. Barbie is a feminist!

As mentioned, Barbie is a toy that can be anything and has a lot of possible careers. She was made to have jobs, which were mostly male-dominant before actual real-life women could reach the job. She seems to have given hope to women on the possibilities of careers in the world, even if she is very rarely referenced. But at the time, she was one of the only models of possible careers that seemed impossible for women.  She had a life before most women in the real world.  Barbie has been leading the way in careers that seemed impossible before for decades. 

  

### 3. Barbie causes a distorted image of women

______________________________________________________________________________

  

One question that is raised with the toy Barbie is the body shape of the doll. The dimension that is unrealistic for a woman of the real world, even Margot Robbie was ? for the dimension of the role.  his is a reason for the character Sacha in the movie to underline that Barbie “sent the feminist movement 50 years back”.  The reason for the proportions of the Barbie is still being discussed. Is it women for the male gaze, just the men’s vision, or the vision of women on themselves? Can we see Barbie as the superwoman of the feminist movement or as the puppet for the imagination of men? Nevertheless,  the proportions of Barbie have stayed the same for over 60 years.
