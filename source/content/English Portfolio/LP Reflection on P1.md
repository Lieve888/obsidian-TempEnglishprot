Did it help you to identify any weaknesses or strengths? How did you approach the task? What lessons did you learn? (don't complain about the time!)


Having 1 hour to write a Paper 1 was a challenge. It has been more than 2 months since I worked on the subjects of Paper 1. However, I had worked on the analysis and interpretation of both literary and non-literary works in English. The work has improved my analysis of literary texts. As a weakness, I am still struggling to create a coherent thesis statement. 

My approach to the task was to read the text and annotate as much information as possible. Then, I read the prompt, highlighting key words, and linked my annotations to the prompt on a separate paper sheet. After writing down all the initial ideas and having a general idea of what to explore, I create three body parts that I will explore. Once I had identified two themes, I began writing my introduction. For the first body paragraph, I look at the ideas I had written down to compose my argument. 

In this session, I gained a deeper understanding of the use of rhetoric in a specific text. This is not necessarily related to learning, but exercices are key to succeeding.
