[[Barbie Opinion article]]
[[Barbie]]

Rationale:

  

On the occasion of the release of the movie Barbie, articles were published for different reasons. Teen Vogue magazine wrote an article about the history of the creator of the toy Barbie and the history of the toy itself. This article was released in the format of information that was omitted from the film about history.  The format used is well used to spread information for its ability to give the reader a perspective on the history of Barbie. The format is composed on a clickbait headline and an introduction with a powerful hoock. The way the paragraphs are organized with titles makes the reader's experience easier. In the case of Baribie’s history, without much effect, the article could be perceived as more tiring; even more for a young person. Additionally, the use of familiar language makes it more accessible for a young audience to have an experience of the author personally talking to you. It is a powerful tool if the subject is related to women such as an article about Barbie. Taking all into account, the format of the article is appropriate for sharing information on the history of Barbie as a tool. 

The event that was the most important in my opinion article was the release of the Barbie which brought a lot to the perception of the Barbie doll but also information on the possible implication of Barbie in the feminist movement. The intended readers of my article are the same as the article of Teen Vogue magazine, young women looking for information that is often on the subject of women in the world. The purpose of using this article for my own is to transmit the information in a format that is familiar and still talks about women positively (from what I have read from them). They want to transmit information to a feminist audience and so do I. 

The main authorial choice I have made for this task is using familiar language is the purpose of a feminist opinion article. An example of the use of familiar is: “(I mean, Ken asking if he’s still hot when he’s in his feelings? If that’s not showing how patriarchy harms men, I don’t know what is).” in the last paragraph of the article. Using this specific article was an opportunity in this context. The article uses familiar language and references that are not strictly about books or popular liberal movies making it easier to write about.
