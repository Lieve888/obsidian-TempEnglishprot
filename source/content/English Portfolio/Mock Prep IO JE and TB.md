Introduction:
Good morning, today I will explore the theme of culture, identity, and community but more precisely how
Family and family structure are key to the development of an individual, especially a woman. The literary
and non-literary texts I have chosen are Jane Eyre, a 19th-century romance by Charlotte Brontë that
follows a young woman, Jane Eyre, who obtains a lifetime of experience and gains the idea of a family on
her path of life, and “Julianne Moore and Family” a part of a photography exposition, Family Ties, By
Tina Barney which is of capturing intimate, staged moments of family life in the eye of Tina Barney. In the
study of those texts, I will show the link of both texts to the idea of how family shapes the development of
ourselves as individuals.
Body 1: Jane Eyre
The story follows Jane Eyre, an orphaned girl who rises from a hard childhood to become a strong
woman. After leaving her position as a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she fell in love with Mr.
Rochester, Jane creates a new chapter in her life. The chosen extract takes place during her time at Moor
House, where she finds family and belonging with her cousins, Diana and Mary Rivers. The extract is
about her using the inheritance she just received to renovate the place of who she considers family. This
moment of her life represented her growth and her desire to conserve the sense of belonging that she has
with Diana and Mary.
Jane highly values family which, in this extract, she fulfils her need to belong to a family. Tho, the
challenge she has to overcome is the her antithesis St.John which has a very different meaning of love
than her and is criticism her attachment to re,novating the house for her cousins against her own belief
that joy and purpose can be found in family connections.Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of that. And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which
you throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.
Don’t cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them
on trite transient objects. Do you hear, Jane?’
He clearly demonstrates opposition to her idea of a family and tries to discourage her from having those
links of a family with Diana and Mary and to save herself.
After that end of the discussion, she happily renovates the house for your cousins with Hannah in joy.Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the
bustle of a house turned topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.
She works hardly and comes to the conclusion of her cleaning is pleasing to her and
Being at Moore gives her:
to rebuild her sense of stability and self.
The extract outlines that Moore gave him a place to exercise her creativity and autonomy but also the
possibility to emotionally bond with Diana and Mary which affirmed her sense of belonging and
self-worth and was a key to her rebuilding of her sense of stability and self.
In summary, in this extract, Jane seems to prove that family has a positive impact on the individual by
showing her emotional nourishment and representing autonomy in the family setting.
Body 2: Julianne Moore and Family
Julianne Moore and Family represents
- A scene of an upper-class family
- A scene with some light reflecting the mother more than anything else
- A woman looking distracted but still leads her hand to her kid
- Reflecting on herself
- Trying to help the kid down the stairs?
- The husband in the back picture
- No help from him
- Weaponized incompetence (showing incompetence so other do more work)
- She is the main person of the family
- So family is her burden.
- She is isolated
- Family as a Source of Tension and Reflection.
- J.M. is emotionally distant from her family.
- J.M. is the central character of the picture but also the central character of the
family.
- J.M. is struggling to have her identity with her familial role.
In summary, in this picture, Julianne Moore seems to prove that family has a negative impact on the
individual by showing the implicit burden of a family on a woman, her emotional distance and the
representation of identity within the family.
Body 3: The link
Both texts demonstrate family but from a different angle, in different ways and with different conflicts but
still…
- Angle
The decision of the way of work.
- Way
- A picture (Non-literary text).
- A Book (literary text).
Jane Eyre is a book and so might be more explicit as Julianne Moore and Family is a picture and so is
more implicit in the meaning of a concept.
- Conflicts and Impact of family.
- Negative vs. positive but still family
Jane Eyre:
- Emotional nourishment
- autonomy in the family setting
Julianne Moore:
- burden of a family on a woman
- emotional distance
- Identity in the family (contrasting theme with Jane Eyre)
Conclusion:
Together, these perspectives enrich the question of how family and family structure are key to the
development of an individual, especially a woman, demonstrating that family, whether supportive or
challenging, plays a central role in shaping a woman’s identity. This duality reflects the complexity of
familial relationships and their profound impact on personal development.




Extract: (Page: 596 (on the internet version))
‘To the end of turning to profit the talents which God
has committed to your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict account. Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of that. And try to re- strain the disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures. Don’t cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ar- dour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects. Do you hear, Jane?’
‘Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have ad-
equate cause to be happy, and I WILL be happy. Goodbye!’ Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook. And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delight- ful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made. I had previously taken a journey to S- to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me CARTE BLANCHE TO effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations.Still somenovelty was necessary, to give to their return the piquan-cy with which I wished it to be invested.
