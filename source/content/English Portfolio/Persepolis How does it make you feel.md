[[English Portfolio/Persepolis-Marjane Satrapi]]*

**How would you feel if you had to wear a headscarf (hijab) in public and at school
every day?
 * Disturbing that they do that, but okay sure, let me keep my
life

**How would you feel if you were conscripted to fight in a war which you did not
believe in?
* Sadness and pain. It would not be a present experience.  But anyway, I could not be recruited to fight at war or die too easily

**How would you feel if you were sent to boarding school?
* If there are interesting people/books, it is not a problem

**How would you feel if you lived in an autocracy or dictatorship (and not a
democracy)?
* Oppressed, in need of escape. This climate is certanally not ideal.
