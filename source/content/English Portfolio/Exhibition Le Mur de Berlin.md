The exhibition was rich in visual information from the period of the Berlin Wall. Some seem to be out of the subject. However, they were linked to the Berlin Wall and brought a greater picture of what the Berlin Wall was. The exhibition was not too biased compared to expectations, given that France was not neutral. Still, it is impossible to obtain objects/information from East Germany Soviet Union if they were not shared after the world, making this exhibition more West Germany-centred. The exhibition was limited in colours, not only by the lack of access to colour photography, but also as a way to control the central colours expressed by the art.

Theme: Children in Politics
Children are symbols of innocence. This image is what the Soviets called "America's youngest Peace ambassador". It is quite peculiar that the Soviets chose a symbol of innocence to refer to America’s ambassador, a high-society status.

Theme: Irony of Politics when faced with a war.
On one hand, the dran dov brings the symbolism of peace. On the other hand, the dove is shown in the form of a war instrument, a tank. This drawing is a critique of the Soviet Union. The phrase "Pax sovietica"  means "Soviet Peace" in Latin.
